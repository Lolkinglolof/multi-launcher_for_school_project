integrate ubisoft_lib

(Alvin):the gitignore prevents me from uploading the images, which causes a crash on everyone else's end
[L]note to Alvin, you can add them as an item to the solution, don't do it through the files, just use the in built function in visual studio :)

there is no support for people who have games from steam on multiple different drives
so Steam is found in one place, but there is also a SteamLibrary in another
[L]Idea to solve: try copying the steamlocator function and changing it to search for libraries instead ( they are usually located directly in the drives )

epic games still reads non-games (DLCs) as games
[L]i'm going to fix that now, it's quite easy
[L]i think i fixed it, it seems like it says in the "AppName" property if it's a dlc "DodoDLC2Mancana" for example, which is a dlc, so i made a check there if it contains dlc
