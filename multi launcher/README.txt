--Thanks for downloading our software--

we wanted to create an easier way for gamers, with lots of games in multiple places, to find their games quickly and without too much work.
we made it because we were interested in how to make a program communicate with other programs and make cross compatibility.
this programs solves the problem where you stare at endless libraries of games not knowing what to play, and the problem abut forgetting some games exist.
we learnt how to work in winforms and generally how to search through files using code.
